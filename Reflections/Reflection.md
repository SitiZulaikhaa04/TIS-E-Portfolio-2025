| 🖥️ PC Assembly            | The hands‑on session helped me finally “see” how each part connects. Taking apart and rebuilding the desktop gave me confidence in understanding the CPU, RAM, and motherboard. | I’d like to practice assembling faster and neater, especially with cable management, so I feel more professional next time. |
| 🖼️ Industry Talk          | Listening to industry leaders opened my eyes to how resilient and innovative companies can be. Their stories made me reflect on my own learning journey. | I want to explore emerging tech areas more deeply and apply the “work smarter, not harder” mindset in my projects. |
| 🎥 Industry Visit          | Walking through the company’s environment made everything feel real. The Q&A sessions gave me clarity on how theory translates into practice. | Next time, I’ll prepare sharper questions and focus on observing workflows so I can connect them to my studies. |
| 📊 Design Thinking Project | Collaborating with my team taught me the value of sharing ideas and dividing tasks. Even when challenges came up, we pushed through together. | I’d like to document our iterations better and strengthen my teamwork strategies so future projects run even smoother. |
